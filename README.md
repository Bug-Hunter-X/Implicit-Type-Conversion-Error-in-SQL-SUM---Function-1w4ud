This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving implicit type conversion during aggregate functions. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that fails due to the presence of non-numeric values in a column used with the `SUM()` function.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a solution using explicit type conversion or filtering to handle such cases. This scenario highlights the importance of data validation and careful type handling in SQL queries to prevent runtime errors.
